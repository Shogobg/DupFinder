Dup Finder is a project i created to learn how C#.NET applications for Windows are made.
My motivation was that i have a huge folder of downloads and many of the files there are duplicated,
so i wanted to clean the duplicates before i move the files to permanent storage.

The project targets .NET Framework 4.5.2 but it may work on a lower version, since it doesn't use
anything special, up to my knowledge. Compiles without issues on MS Visual Studio 2017 community.
